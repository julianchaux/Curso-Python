# Debugging Odd or Even

# Instructions
# Read this the code in main.py
# Spot the problems 🐞.
# Modify the code to fix the program.
# Fix the code so that it works and passes the tests when you submit.

# Hint
# Review the previous lesson and go through the 10 steps to tackle these debugging problems.

# Code Before Debugging
# number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

# if number % 2 = 0:
#   print("This is an even number.")
# else:
#   print("This is an odd number.")

#Code After Debugging
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an even number.")
